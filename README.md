# **Lyrical Pop Quiz**

## **Code Institute Portfolio Project II**

## **Background**
I love music and specially singing along to it. No matter if under the shower, in the car or whenever a good lyric just gets me. People around me would probably say I’m quite good with lyrics but when put to a test I can confidently say, this is not the case. Often, we use the words we think are the lyrics but if checked mostly it just sound similar. 
If you want to know how good your lyrical knowledge of popular songs is then this is the perfect game for you!

## **Design Choices**
### **Color Palette**

The idea behind the color palette was reflecting the mood of a 90's pop art comic with its vibrant and contrasting colors.

### **Typography**

The Fonts used is [Bungee](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Bungee) and [Martel](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Martel). Bungee is a typeface that celebrates the urban sign. Martel is a libre font development project. Bungee being bold and round reminded me of somehting playfull and comic-like. This is why I choose the font. I used Martel on the rules page to make it more readable and underline the less playful information.
