# **Lyrical Pop Quiz**

## **Code Institute Portfolio Project II**

## **Background**
I love music and specially singing along to it. No matter if under the shower, in the car or whenever a good lyric just gets me. People around me would probably say Iâ€™m quite good with lyrics but when put to a test I can confidently say, this is not the case. Often, we use the words we think are the lyrics but if checked mostly it just sound similar. 
If you want to know how good your lyrical knowledge of popular songs is then this is the perfect game for you!
